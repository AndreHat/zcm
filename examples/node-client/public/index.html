      RRR: source the socket.io file first. Note that socket.io must be npm-installed on the
           server side and "required" in the server, but then it automatically serves the client
           side code at this url without any other user code. Granted, it means we need to have
           2 lines of user code on the html side rather than 1, but I think it's a pretty minimal
           cost to always have the correct version of the socket.io client without having it in
           our git repo
